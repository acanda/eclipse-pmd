New and noteworthy
Improved Golang CPD Support

Thanks to the work of ITBA students Matías Fraga, Tomi De Lucca and Lucas Soncini, Golang is now backed by a proper Antlr Grammar. This means CPD is now better at detecting duplicates, as comments are recognized as such and ignored.
New Rules

    The new PLSQL rule CodeFormat (plsql-codestyle) verifies that PLSQL code is properly formatted. It checks e.g. for correct indentation in select statements and verifies that each parameter is defined on a separate line.

API Changes

    PMD has a new CLI option -ignorelist. With that, you can provide a file containing a comma-delimit list of files, that should be excluded during analysis. The ignorelist is applied after the files have been selected via -dir or -filelist, which means, if the file is in both lists, then it will be ignored. Note: there is no corresponding option for the Ant task, since the feature is already available via Ant’s FileSet include/exclude filters.
