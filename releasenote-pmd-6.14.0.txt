Modified Rules

    The Java rule AssignmentToNonFinalStatic (java-errorprone) will now report on each assignment made within a constructor rather than on the field declaration. This makes it easier for developers to find the offending statements.

    The Java rule NoPackage (java-codestyle) will now report additionally enums and annotations that do not have a package declaration.
