Feature Request and Improvements:

#1344: AbstractNaming should check reverse
#1361: ShortVariable and ShortMethodName configuration
#1414: Command line parameter to disable "failOnViolation" behavior
       PMD and CPD Command Line Interfaces have a new optional parameter: `failOnViolation`. Executing PMD with the option
       `-failOnViolation false` will perform the PMD checks but won't fail the build and still exit with status 0.
       This is useful if you only want to generate the report with violations but don't want to fail your build.
#1420: UnusedPrivateField: Ignore fields if using lombok

New Rules:

   Java:

    *   Basic: SimplifiedTernary (rulesets/java/basic.xml/SimplifiedTernary)<br/>
        Ternary operator with a boolean literal can be simplified with a boolean
        expression.

    *   Clone: CloneMethodMustBePublic (rulesets/java/clone.xml/CloneMethodMustBePublic)<br/>
        The java manual says "By convention,
        classes that implement the `Cloneable` interface should override `Object.clone` (which is protected)
        with a public method."

    *   Clone: CloneMethodReturnTypeMustMatchClassName (rulesets/java/clone.xml/CloneMethodReturnTypeMustMatchClassName)<br/>
        If a class implements `Cloneable`
        the return type of the method `clone()` must be the class name.

    *   Comments: CommentDefaultAccessModifier (rulesets/java/comments.xml/CommentDefaultAccessModifier)<br/>
        In order to avoid mistakes with
        forgotten access modifiers for methods, this rule ensures, that you explicitly mark the usage of the
        default access modifier by placing a comment.

    *   Design: SingletonClassReturningNewInstance (rulesets/java/design.xml/SingletonClassReturningNewInstance)<br/>
        Verifies that the method called `getInstance` returns a cached instance and not always a fresh, new instance.

    *   Design: SingleMethodRule (rulesets/java/design.xml/SingleMethodSingletonRule)<br/>
        Verifies that there is only one method called
        `getInstance`. If there are more methods that return the singleton, then it can easily happen, that these
        are not the same instances - and thus no singleton.

    *   Unnecessary: UselessQualifiedThis (rulesets/java/unnecessary.xml/UselessQualifiedThis)<br/>
        Flags unnecessary qualified usages
        of this, when `this` alone would be unique. E.g. use just `this` instead of `Foo.this`.

*   Maven POM: (The rules can be found in the *pmd-xml* module)

    *   Basic: ProjectVersionAsDependencyVersion (rulesets/pom/basic.xml/ProjectVersionAsDependencyVersion)<br/>
        Checks the usage of `${project.version}` in Maven POM files.

    *   Basic: InvalidDependencyTypes (rulesets/pom/basic.xml/InvalidDependencyTypes)<br/>
        Verifies that only the default types (jar, war, ...) for dependencies are used.

Modified Rules:

*   Java

    *   Basic: CheckResultSet (rulesets/java/basic.xml/CheckResultSet)<br/>
        Do not require to check the result of a navigation method, if it is returned.

    *   JUnit: UseAssertTrueInsteadOfAssertEquals (rulesets/java/junit.xml/UseAssertTrueInsteadOfAssertEquals)<br/>
        This rule also flags assertEquals, that use Boolean.TRUE/FALSE constants.

    *   Naming: AbstractNaming (rulesets/java/naming.xml/AbstractNaming)<br/>
        By default, this rule flags now classes,
        that are named "Abstract" but are not abstract. This behavior can be disabled by setting
        the new property `strict` to false.

    *   Naming: ShortMethodName (rulesets/java/naming.xml/ShortMethodName)<br/>
        Additional property `minimum` to configure the minimum required length of a method name.

    *   Naming: ShortVariable (rulesets/java/naming.xml/ShortVariable)<br/>
        Additional property `minimum` to configure the minimum required length of a variable name.

    *   UnusedCode: UnusedPrivateField (rulesets/java/unusedcode.xml/UnusedPrivateField)<br/>
        This rule won't trigger anymore if Lombok is in use.
        See #1420.

Renamed Rules:

*   Java
    *   Design: UseSingleton -> UseUtilityClass (rulesets/java/design.xml/UseUtilityClass)<br/>
        The rule "UseSingleton" *has been renamed* to "UseUtilityClass".
        See also bugs #1059 and #1339.

Removed Rules:

*   Java
    *   Basic: The following rules of ruleset "Basic" were marked as deprecated and are removed with this release now:<br/>
        <br/>
        EmptyCatchBlock, EmptyIfStatement, EmptyWhileStmt, EmptyTryBlock, EmptyFinallyBlock, EmptySwitchStatements, EmptySynchronizedBlock, EmptyStatementNotInLoop, EmptyInitializer, EmptyStatementBlock, EmptyStaticInitializer
        <br/><br/>
        UnnecessaryConversionTemporary, UnnecessaryReturn, UnnecessaryFinalModifier, UselessOverridingMethod, UselessOperationOnImmutable, UnusedNullCheckInEquals, UselessParentheses
        <br/><br/>
        These rules are still available in the rulesets "Empty" (rulesets/java/empty.xml) and
        "Unnecessary" (rulesets/java/unnecessary.xml) respectively.

    *   Design: The rule "UncommentedEmptyMethod" has been renamed last release to "UncommentedEmptyMethodBody". The
        old rule name reference has been removed with this release now.

    *   Controversial: The rule "BooleanInversion" has been deprecated last release
        and has been removed with this release completely.
