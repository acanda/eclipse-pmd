New and noteworthy

PL/SQL Grammar improvements

    In this release, many more parser bugs in our PL/SQL support have been fixed. This adds more complete support for UPDATE statements and subqueries and hierarchical queries in SELECT statements.
    Support for analytic functions such as LISTAGG has been added.
    Conditions in WHERE clauses support now REGEX_LIKE and multiset conditions.

New Rules

    The new Java rule UseTryWithResources (apex-codestyle) has a new property skipTestMethodUnderscores, which is by default disabled. The new property allows for ignoring all test methods, either using the testMethod modifier or simply annotating them @isTest.
